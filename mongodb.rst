MongoDB
=======
MongoDB is used to store the data collected by the local SQLite database on a
remote server.
This allows the later processing of said data and also the display of the
processed data.

The data stored in MongoDB doesn't follow any pre-defined schema, but is rather
stored in so-called documents, based on JSON (JavaScript Object Notation).
MongoDB also allows storing binary data, which is being stored in BSON (binary
JSON) objects.
